Regression on Uber and Lyft Dataset

Sometimes it is just convenient to leave the driving to someone else. This is just less stress, more mind space and one gets to use that time to do other things. Well, that is one of the ideas that grew and later became the concept behind Uber and Lyft.

Uber is a global company available in 69 countries and around 900 cities worldwide. Lyft, on the other hand, operates in about 644 cities in the US and 12 cities in Canada only. Yet, in the US, itâ€™s the second-largest ridesharing company with a 31% market share.
